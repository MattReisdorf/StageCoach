## Description: <a name="description"></a>
Stagecoach was developed as the final group project for Northwestern's full stack coding bootcamp over the course of a week in June of 2021. The project is designed to simplify show booking for smaller artists and venues by creating a platform in which artists and venues can maintain personalized profiles and create pages for events which dynamically include and direct to their profile information. 

## Usage: <a name="usage"></a>
The majority of Stagecoach's features are available even to users who are not registered or logged in. Calendar view, venue and artist profiles, and the search function are all available to visitors to the site. Upon registration and login, users then have the ability to create events based on the registered artists and venues. 

## Contributing <a name="contributing"></a>
If you would like to contribute to the project, please contact any of the four contributors on GitHub. There is plenty more work to do.
